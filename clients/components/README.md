# Shared Components
This is a library of components that can safely be shared by any React UI, Gutenberg or not and are not specific to a client.


## Components
* `FormSelectorNoGutenberg` A react-bootstrap dependent selector for all saved forms.
* `CalderaHeader` A component to create the header markup of a page.
- Chidl props can be passed. They will be outputted inside of a `ul`. You must supply `li`.
* `PageBody` Wraps the content of an admin page in a consistent wrapper.
