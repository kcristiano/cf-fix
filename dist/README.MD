# `/dist` directory

This directory is used by webpack dev server. Everything except for this file, React and asset-mainifest.json are gitignored.

## asset-manifest.json

Generated by Webpack dev server

## react.min.js and  react-dom.min.js

Used for enqueueing React in admin. Generated by copying from node modules automatically on the `postinstall` hook or manually by `yarn postinstall`

## `dist/caldera-hot-load` directory

This directory, which is gitignored besides the `.gitkeep` file, is used by webpack dev server for hot reloads. Files are written here. When webpack comes in hot for updates, they are served from here. There is a filter is `Caldera_Forms_Render_Assets` that handles server-side routing.
